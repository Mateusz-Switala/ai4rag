    Supports pure vector search and hybrid search (dense vector + tsvector

    Driven by ``asyncpg`` rather than ``psycopg``: asyncpg speaks the Postgres
    wire protocol itself instead of wrapping the ``libpq`` C library, so it
    ships as a normal self-contained wheel with no system ``libpq`` dependency
    and none of ``psycopg[binary]``'s bundled-OpenSSL conflicts. Every public
    method here stays synchronous (matching :class:`BaseVectorStore` and every

        exist, and the in-memory flag avoids re-issuing the DDL on every subsequent search.

        ``search()`` runs concurrently across threads (see
        :attr:`PGVectorConfig.pool_max_size <ai4rag.rag.vector_store.config.PGVectorConfig.pool_max_size>`),
        so the flag check is guarded by :attr:`_indexes_lock` with the standard double-checked
        pattern: without it, two threads can both see ``False``, and both race to run the
        DDL. PostgreSQL's ``IF NOT EXISTS`` is not atomic across concurrent sessions — the
        loser doesn't silently no-op, it raises a real ``UniqueViolationError`` on the system
        catalog. The lock prevents that race for this instance; the ``UniqueViolationError``
        catch below is a second line of defense for a collection shared across instances
        (e.g. reused by another trial), where no Python-level lock can help.

        The HNSW index is only built when :attr:`_embedding_dimension` is within
        pgvector's :attr:`_MAX_INDEXABLE_DIMENSION` limit; above it, this step is
        skipped entirely (search then falls back to an exact sequential scan) while
        the GIN full-text index is still built unconditionally, since it does not
        depend on the embedding column at all.
